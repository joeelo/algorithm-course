# Binary Heaps

## What is a binary heap?

    - Very similar to a binary search tree, but with some different rules! 
    - In a MaxBinaryHeap, parent nodes are always larger than child nodes. 
    - In a MinBinaryHeap, parent nodes are always smaller than child nodes. 

## Max Binary Heap

    - Each Parent has at most two child nodes. 
    - The value of the parent node is ALWAYS greater than the child nodes. 
    - In a Max Binary Heap, the parent is greater than the children, but ther is no guarantees between sibling nodes. 
    - A binary heap is as compact as possible. All the children of each node are as full as they can be and left children are filled out first.
