## Graphs

- Trees are a type of graph.
- Graphs are nodes connected to any number of other nodes

### Use cases

- Recommendation engines, used by Amazon for "bought with" or Netflix' "most watched"
- Pathfinding, Djikstra's algo used by Uber and any other routing app
- You can represent a social network with a graph like facebook friends, to see who you should befriend.

### Types of Graphs

- Vertex = node
- Edge = connection between nodes
- Weighted/Unweighted = values assigned to distances between vertices
- Directed/Undirected = directions assigned to distances between vertices

- In an undirected graph there are no directions with an edge
- Directed graphs display the direction/polarity of edges.

- Unweighted graphs don't have a value associated with an edge, if they do have values on the edges it is a weighted graph.
