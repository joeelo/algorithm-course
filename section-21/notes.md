- Define what a stack is?

    - A LIFO data structure

        - Last In First Out
        - The Last element added to the stack will be the First element removed from the stack

        -Picture a pile of papers, you can't access the papers underneath,
        without first removing the paper on top one by one

    - Managing function invocations
    - Undo / Redo functionality
